# Using Amazon QuickSight to Visualize Data

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **Amazon QuickSight** to analyze and visualize data from a large dataset of Netflix shows and movies. The goal is to create an interactive dashboard that reveals key insights from the data.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Dataset in Amazon S3

- Created an **S3 bucket** to store the dataset (`.csv` file) and the `manifest.json` file.
- Uploaded the dataset to the bucket.
- Edited the `manifest.json` file to include the correct S3 object URL pointing to the dataset.
- Uploaded the modified `manifest.json` file back into the S3 bucket.

## Step 2: Setting Up Amazon QuickSight

- Signed up for an **Amazon QuickSight** account (30-day free trial).
- Enabled **QuickSight access to S3** to allow the tool to process the dataset stored in my bucket.
- Connected QuickSight to my S3 bucket using the manifest file as the data source.

## Step 3: Building Visualizations

- Used the **AutoGraph feature** in QuickSight by dragging relevant fields into the visual pane.
- Created a **donut chart** showing the count of records by release year.
- Built additional charts using various field modifications and filters to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Key Takeaways

- QuickSight makes it easy to explore, analyze, and visualize data from S3 without heavy setup.
- You must grant QuickSight access to the specific S3 bucket where your data is stored.
- Manifest files are essential for connecting S3-stored data to QuickSight when not using built-in connectors.
